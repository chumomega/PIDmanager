Design:

3 main classes
1. Application - This is the PIDManager application
	- int allocate_map(void) � Creates and initializes a data structure for representing pids; returns -1 if unsuccessful and 1 if successful 
	- int allocate_pid(void) � Allocates and returns a pid; returns -1 if if unable to allocate a pid (all pids are in use) 
	- void release_pid(int_pid) � Releases a pid. 
	
2. PIDThread - This creates a thread of the PIDManager application. Each thread will request a pid, sleep for a random period of time, 
	and then release the pid.
	- PIDThread(Application app) � creates a thread from the application
	- void run() � Runs the thread by printing a statement when the thread gets an allocated pid, sleeps, and gets releases.
	
3. Test - This tests the PIDThread application
	- void main() � Tests the program
