The problem statement was to create a manger for PIDs by implementing three functions 
that keeps track of unique PID numbers between the range 300 and 5000. 
The manager can also release a PID that has already been created.

Assumptions:
In order to make sure the data structure created in allocate_map is not limited in scope 
we assumed that the data structure had been declared earlier in the program.
